## Installation

The code is developed based on Pytorch v0.4 with TensorboardX as visualization tools. We recommend to use virtualenv to run our code:

```
$ virtualenv -p python3 scops_env
$ source scops_env/bin/activate
(scops_env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, run `$ deactivate`. To activate the environment again, run `$ source scops_env/bin/activate`.

## SCOPS on Unaligned CelebA

Download data (Saliency, labels, pretrained model) 

```$ ./download_CelebA.sh```

Download CelebA unaligned from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EVK8r0v71peklHb0pGdDl6R28).

## Test the pretrained model

```$ ./evaluate_celebAWild.sh``` and accept all default options. The results are stored in a single webpage at ```results_CelebA/SCOPS_K8/ITER_100000/web_html/index.html```.

## Train the model

```$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES={GPU} python train.py -f exps/SCOPS_K8_retrain.json``` where `{GPU}` is the GPU device number.
